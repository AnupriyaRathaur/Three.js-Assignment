# Three.js Assignment â€“ Object Highlighter Using Stencil Buffer

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a 3D scene using Three.js where users can interact with objects (such as cubes or spheres) and highlight them with an outline using the stencil buffer technique.

## Features:
- A 3D scene with a ground plane.
- At least 5 different objects (e.g., box, sphere, cone, etc.) placed in 3D space.
- Directional or point lighting to illuminate the scene.
- OrbitControls for navigating the scene.
- Raycasting to detect mouse clicks and identify which object is selected.
- A stencil buffer outline highlighting the selected object (only one object highlighted at a time).
